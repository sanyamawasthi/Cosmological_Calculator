  <h1>Some basic terminologies and understanding of them</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Cosmological Redshift</li>
    <li>Matter Density</li>
    <li>Radiation Density</li>
    <li>Dark Energy</li>
    <li>Age of Universe and Redshift</li>
    <li>Angular Diameter Distance</li>
    <li>Luminosity Distance</li>
    <li>CMB Temperature</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Go for the <a href="{{url_for('calc')}}" class="button-class">cosmological calculator</a> (click on the grey part
    YO!)</p>

  <h2>Cosmological Redshift :</h2>
  <p>In normal on-going life, we have redshift or blueshift arising due to relative motion between objects. Similarly,
    in cosmology, we have cosmological redshift which not just an indication of relative radial speed between galaxies
    but can also give an idea of how much one has gone into the past. More the value of Cosmological redshift, more old
    universe we are looking at. This is an important parameter to know the age, relative speed, and distance from
    observer to the target galaxy.</p>

  <h2>Density</h2>
  <p>Universe keeps on expanding and this expansion is accelerating as per observations. Now this expansion and speed of
    expansion are not dictated by density of matter, radiation density, and dark energy density</p>

  <h3>Matter Density</h3>
  <p>Comprised of baryonic matter (electron, proton, and neutron) and dark matter.</p>

  <h3>Radiation Density</h3>
  <p>Contributed by radiation from stars, galaxies, and dust. Photons present in the universe is best idea to keep
    better understanding.</p>

  <h3>Dark Energy</h3>
  <p>As universe expands, this expansion accelerates too. Now supernovae were being studied and their brightness was
    calculated. In reality, they were fainter than the brightness recorded. It concluded to presence of new density
    called dark energy density.</p>

  <h2>Age of universe and Redshift</h2>
  <p>To be put simply, more the redshift observed from the galaxy, more old galaxy or universe we are looking at and
    near it is to big bang. For example, galaxy with redshift=7.15 tells that we are looking at galaxy when universe was
    740 million years old.</p>

  <h2>Distance in Cosmology</h2>
  <p>Deriving distance in astronomy is very important and difficult. For different scales, different methods are used to
    derive the distance but we are going to look how distances to galaxy are calculated in cosmology.</p>

  <h3>Angular Diameter Distance</h3>
  <p>Consider that you have some galaxy looking like a large scale of length L. Using that length, you try to estimate
    the distance to that scale-galaxy it subtends some angle Î¸ so that . This can be used to get derive angular
    scale(size per arcsecond or whatever way one wants to look at it).</p>

  <h3>Luminosity Distance</h3>
  <p>What would be the distance to the galaxy with luminosity observed.</p>

  <h2>CMB Temperature</h2>
  <p>CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) is the radiation that has filled the universe and has been present from the
    starting of the universe. Now as universe expanded, the temperature of the CMB also has decreased. Using redshift,
    one can determine the temperature for the universe at that redshift. For present universe, the temperature is 2.3 K.
